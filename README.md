You can download the necessary files to follow this notebook from the link below:

You should download both Update files, which are for June (which is the time at which she works home office) and November (she works at the office), respectively. In the notebook, I generally focused on November data mainly because it has almost 2-weeks of more data than June. 

Lastly, I hope this work would give anyone who would like to get his/her hands dirty on analysing time-series data a good starting point.
