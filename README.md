You should download both Update files, which are for June (which is the time at which she works home office) and November (she works at the office), respectively. In the notebook, I generally focused on November data mainly because it has almost 2-weeks of more data than June.

I have downloaded __CLEAN_REFIT_081116.7z__ file from the above link and focused on House_1 and House_2 for data analysis and modeling. In __Refit_GPU__ notebook, I have pickled the house files so that they don't take up huge memory on my system.

Lastly, I hope this work would give anyone who would like to get his/her hands dirty on analysing time-series data a good starting point.
